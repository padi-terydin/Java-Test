## Java Coding Interview Question: Sorting Without Streams

**Question:**  
Write a Java method that takes an array of integers as input and returns a new array containing the same integers sorted in ascending order. **You are not allowed to use the Java Stream API or any built-in Java sorting methods (such as `Arrays.sort()`, `Collections.sort()`, or similar).**  
You may use only basic Java language constructs, such as loops, arrays, and conditionals.

**Function Signature:**  
```java
public static int[] sortArray(int[] input)
```

**Example:**  
```java
Input: [4, 2, 7, 1, 3]
Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 7]
```

**Constraints:**
- Do not use the Java Stream API.
- Do not use built-in sorting methods.
- Your solution should have a time complexity better than O(nÂ²) if possible.
- Provide both the code and a brief explanation of your approach.
